 Saturated hydraulic conductivity equal to zero for one or more soil layers.   
 Data will be treated as missing.                                              

 SOILDYN  YEAR DOY = 1980 165
 The CENTURY-based soil-organic-matter module needs                            
 soil texture data, but the specified soil profile                             
 does not have those for some layers. The model will                           
 run with the default 30% clay, 30% silt, 40% sand.                            
 This may give incorrect results.

 To change allowable N content, modify SCN parameter
