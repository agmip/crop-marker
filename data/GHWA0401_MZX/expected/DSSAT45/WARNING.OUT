 The carbon/nutrient ratio (C/N or C/P) of the residue                         
 or senesced biomass that was added to the soil                                
 is outside the common range to which the CESTR                                
 parameter in the file SOMFX045.SDA applies. You have a                        
 residue with an extremely low nutrient concentration.                         
 Please check your data and/or adapt the CESTR value.
